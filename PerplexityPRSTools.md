# Comprehensive Table of Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Tools

This report presents a compilation of polygenic risk score (PRS) tools in a structured markdown table format as requested. Polygenic risk scores are statistical tools that estimate an individual's genetic predisposition to a particular trait or disease by aggregating the effects of multiple genetic variants.

## Available PRS Tools

Based on the available search results, I've compiled information on PRS tools. While the search results contain mentions of several tools, comprehensive link information is limited. I've populated the table with all available links from the search results.

| Tool Name | Tool PDF Document | GitHub Link | R Package Link | Python Package Link | Published Article | DOI Link | Website Link |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| PRSKB | | | | | https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03795-x | | https://prs.byu.edu |

## PRS Method Categories

The search results indicate that PRS methods generally fall into four main categories[3]:

### Clumping and Thresholding (C+T) Approaches
These methods shrink effect sizes of non-significant SNPs to zero according to their p-values and account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) by clumping variants at a given LD level. Tools in this category mentioned in the search results include:

| Tool Name | Tool PDF Document | GitHub Link | R Package Link | Python Package Link | Published Article | DOI Link | Website Link |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| CT-Meta | | | | | | | |

### Machine Learning (ML) Methods
These approaches select variants jointly using penalized regression, where the number of selected causal variants is controlled by the penalty parameter. Tools in this category mentioned in the search results include:

| Tool Name | Tool PDF Document | GitHub Link | R Package Link | Python Package Link | Published Article | DOI Link | Website Link |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| TL-Multi | | | | | | | |
| mtPRS-ML | | | | | | | |
| mtPRS-MultiReg | | | | | | | |
| CTPR | | | | | | | |

### Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUP) Methods
These methods account for LD through a linear mixed effects model. Tools in this category mentioned in the search results include:

| Tool Name | Tool PDF Document | GitHub Link | R Package Link | Python Package Link | Published Article | DOI Link | Website Link |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| XP-BLUP | | | | | | | |
| wMT-SBLUP | | | | | | | |

### Bayesian Approaches
These methods explicitly model causal effects and LD to infer the posterior distribution of causal effect sizes. Tools in this category mentioned in the search results include:

| Tool Name | Tool PDF Document | GitHub Link | R Package Link | Python Package Link | Published Article | DOI Link | Website Link |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| DBSLMM | | | | | | | |
| SBayesR | | | | | | | |
| PRS-CSx | | | | | | | |

## Conclusion

This report presents a structured table of polygenic risk score tools based on the available search results. The most detailed information is available for PRSKB, which offers a user-friendly online calculator and command-line interface for calculating polygenic risk scores across multiple traits and studies[2]. 

For a more comprehensive table with complete link information for all tools, additional research would be required. The search results indicate that there are numerous PRS tools available across different methodological categories, but specific links to their repositories, packages, and documentation were limited in the provided context.
