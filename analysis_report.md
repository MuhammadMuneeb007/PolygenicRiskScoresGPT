# Analysis Report for Train_with_outliers.jsonl

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a question-answer dataset containing **23278** pairs. The dataset exhibits **high** complexity with a diversity score of **0.822** (95% CI: 0.820-0.824). Based on content and structural analysis, we recommend fine-tuning a **meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-instruct** model with the optimized hyperparameters detailed in Section 5.

## 2. Dataset Statistics

| Metric | Questions | Explanations |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Average Length (tokens) | 19.0 | 242.0 |
| Median Length (tokens) | 18.0 | 144.0 |
| Maximum Length (tokens) | 64 | 1943 |
| 90th Percentile Length | 26.0 | 563.0 |
| Contains Code | 73.5% | 99.7% |

The dataset contains a total of approximately **6,075,868** tokens. The distribution of tokens suggests a high-complexity dataset that requires a sequence length of at least **2048** tokens to accommodate the longest samples.

## 3. Content Analysis

### 3.1 Topic Distribution

The semantic analysis identified **2** distinct topics in the questions:

- **Topic_1**: does (5234.622), ldpred (2296.745), polypred (1737.436), gibbs (1632.667), purpose (1375.871)
- **Topic_2**: plink (3124.575), file (2854.358), using (2273.454), data (2166.480), ldak (1594.357)

### 3.2 Complexity Assessment

The dataset complexity was assessed as **High** with a complexity score of **12.32**. This assessment is based on multiple factors:

- Semantic diversity: 0.822
- Average explanation length: 242.0 tokens
- Code presence in explanations: 99.7%
- Average question length: 19.0 tokens

- Topic model perplexity: 453.22

## 4. Training Data Recommendations

Based on the dataset characteristics, we recommend the following data split:

- Training samples: 18622 (79% of dataset)
- Testing samples: 4655 (19% of dataset)

## 5. Hyperparameter Recommendations

For optimal fine-tuning results, we recommend the following hyperparameters:

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Base Model | meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-instruct | Selected based on dataset complexity and size |
| Sequence Length | 2048 | Accommodates 102% of the maximum required length |
| Epochs | 10 | Optimized for dataset size of 23278 samples |
| Learning Rate | 1e-05 | Adjusted for high complexity content |
| Batch Size | 2 with 4 gradient accumulation steps | Optimized for model size and memory efficiency |
| LoRA Rank (r) | 32 | Selected based on dataset diversity and complexity |
| LoRA Alpha | 64 | Set to 2x LoRA rank for optimal adaptation |
| LoRA Dropout | 0.05 | Higher value for robustness with complex data |

For generation during evaluation and inference, we recommend:

- Maximum generation length: 844 tokens
- Temperature: 0.7
- Top-p (nucleus sampling): 0.92
- Minimum-p: 0.1
