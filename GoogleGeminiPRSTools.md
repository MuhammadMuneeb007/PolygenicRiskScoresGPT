Comprehensive Catalog of Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Computational ToolsI. Introduction to Polygenic Risk Score ToolsPolygenic Risk Scores (PRS) represent a quantitative metric of an individual's genetic predisposition to complex traits and diseases. This is achieved by aggregating the cumulative effects of numerous genetic variants, predominantly single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).1 Unlike Mendelian disorders, which are typically linked to variants in a single gene, complex diseases result from the intricate interplay of many genetic variants, each contributing a small effect, in conjunction with environmental factors such as diet, sleep, stress, and lifestyle choices.4The application of PRS has become an integral component of biomedical research, extending across diverse domains. These scores are utilized for predicting individual disease risk, stratifying patients into distinct risk groups, investigating differential responses to treatments, and inferring shared genetic etiology among various traits.1 The utility and predictive power of PRS are continuously advancing, propelled by the rapid expansion of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that identify an increasing number of robust genetic associations.8The burgeoning landscape of PRS methodologies and computational software necessitates a centralized and organized resource for researchers. This report aims to fulfill this need by providing a comprehensive, link-only table of prominent PRS computational tools.

Navigating and Utilizing PRS Tools: Key Trends and ConsiderationsThe landscape of Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) tool development has undergone significant evolution, marked by a shift from general-purpose genetic analysis software to highly specialized computational solutions. This progression is a direct response to the increasing complexity of genetic data and the growing demands for both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency in PRS computation.Evolution of PRS Tool Development: From General to SpecializedHistorically, foundational PRS methodologies, such as Clumping and Thresholding (C+T or P+T), were often implemented as functionalities within broader, general-purpose genetic analysis software like PLINK.7 While PLINK offers extensive utility for general genomic data manipulation, it is not primarily designed as a dedicated PRS-specific tool.11 The early reliance on these general-purpose tools for basic PRS methods indicated an initial phase of PRS development where simpler statistical approaches were prevalent.However, as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) expanded in scale and the understanding of complex genetic architecture deepened—particularly concerning linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the highly polygenic nature of traits—these simpler methods proved insufficient for optimal prediction. This inadequacy spurred the innovation of more advanced statistical models, including Bayesian methods (e.g., LDpred2, PRS-CS), penalized regression (e.g., lassosum), and even neural networks (e.g., PNL).6 The implementation of these complex models necessitated dedicated software to ensure computational feasibility, accuracy, and scalability, especially for "biobank-scale data".5 This shift from generic to purpose-built tools reflects the maturation of the PRS field and its specialization, focusing on algorithms optimized for specific PRS challenges. The ripple effect of this specialization is a higher technical barrier for users, who now require more specific software knowledge beyond general bioinformatics skills.Programming Language Landscape: Dominance of R and PythonThe open-source ecosystem for PRS tools is significantly shaped by the widespread adoption of R and Python. Numerous prominent tools, such as LDpred2 and lassosum (implemented as R packages), PRS-CS and PNL (primarily Python-based), and SBayesRC (an R implementation), exemplify this trend.14 The pervasive use of R and Python underscores their critical role in computational biology. These languages offer extensive libraries for statistical analysis, machine learning, and efficient data handling, which collectively facilitate rapid development and broad accessibility of tools.The open-source nature of these tools, frequently hosted on platforms like GitHub, actively promotes transparency, encourages community contributions, and, most importantly, enhances the reproducibility of scientific findings.15 A significant challenge in bioinformatics has traditionally been managing complex software dependencies across different computing environments. The emergence of containerization technologies, such as Docker for SBayesRC and Singularity for LDpred2, directly addresses this "works on my machine" problem, ensuring that analyses can be reliably replicated across diverse computational infrastructures.16 The broader implication for the research community is that proficiency in these programming languages, coupled with familiarity with version control and containerization, is becoming an increasingly essential skill set for statistical geneticists.Advancements in Statistical Modeling for Enhanced Predictive AccuracyContemporary PRS tools leverage sophisticated statistical methodologies that extend far beyond rudimentary P-value thresholding. These advanced approaches encompass Bayesian inference (e.g., LDpred2, PRS-CS, SBayesR), penalized regression (e.g., lassosum), and even neural network architectures (e.g., PNL).6 A paramount objective of these methods is to accurately account for linkage disequilibrium (LD) and to model the diverse underlying genetic architectures of complex traits.12Early PRS methods, such as Clumping and Thresholding (C+T), were straightforward but often limited in their predictive power because they struggled to fully capture the intricate genetic relationships, particularly LD.11 The subsequent shift towards Bayesian methods (LDpred2, PRS-CS) and penalized regression (lassosum) directly addresses this limitation by incorporating more realistic assumptions about SNP effect sizes and the underlying LD structure.12 The development of "sparse" models (LDpred2) and continuous shrinkage priors (PRS-CS) represents a crucial advancement, acknowledging that not all SNPs contribute equally to a trait.9 This leads to more precise and parsimonious models. For instance, LDpred2 incorporates "sparse" and "auto" options, enabling the direct learning of SNP effects and model parameters from data, which significantly enhances accuracy and robustness.14 The ultimate outcome of these continuous statistical improvements is a significant enhancement in the accuracy and reliability of PRS.6 This heightened accuracy is a fundamental prerequisite for the widespread adoption of PRS in clinical settings, enabling more effective risk stratification, precise diagnoses, and ultimately, truly personalized medicine strategies.Addressing Population Diversity: The Imperative of Cross-Ancestry PredictionA critical challenge in the application of PRS is their transferability across diverse human populations. The majority of genomic data and, consequently, PRS models have historically been derived from individuals of European descent.8 This creates a significant disparity in predictive accuracy when these models are directly applied to non-European ancestries, where differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns, allele frequencies, and underlying genetic architectures can substantially reduce performance.8The field is actively developing methods to address this limitation. Tools like PRS-CSx are specifically designed to integrate GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations to improve cross-population prediction performance.13 Similarly, SBayesRC aims to leverage functional genomic annotations with high-density SNPs for polygenic prediction, considering ancestry-matched LD data.16 The development of such multi-ancestry and trans-ethnic approaches is crucial for ensuring that the benefits of PRS can be equitably extended to all global populations, mitigating potential health disparities that might arise from ancestry-specific biases in current genomic resources.8 This ongoing effort underscores the commitment to developing robust and generalizable PRS models that are applicable across the full spectrum of human genetic diversity.IV.
